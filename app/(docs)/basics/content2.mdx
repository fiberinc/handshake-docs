# FAQ

## Can I merge Handshake into my existing app?

You're very welcome to try. We designed Handshake to be a standalone application, but you can try to copy-paste its code into your existing Next.js app. Keep in mind that this will make upgrades more difficult.


## Can you host Handshake for me?

Handshake was designed with self-hosting in mind. The team at Fiber can host.
